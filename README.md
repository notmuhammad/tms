# Training Management System
Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind

## Process
The requirements did not provide many details. I started off by creating a mid-fidelity design in Figma. After I was satisfied, I started the actual implementation.

### Tailwind
While I'm very comfortable with using vanilla CSS, I prefer using Tailwind because it allows me to move fast and achieve the same results. Its ergonomics and utility classes are a joy to use.

## Install
`npm install`

## Run in development mode
`npm run dev`
